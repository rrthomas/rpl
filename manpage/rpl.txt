NAME
  rpl - replace strings in files

SYNOPSIS
  rpl [-LhiwbqvsRepfdt] [-xSUFFIX] <old_string> <new_string> <target_file ...>

DESCRIPTION
  rpl is an intelligent recursive search and replacement utility. It will
  change strings with new strings in multiple text files at the same time.

  rpl can verify, find and edit several plain texts quickly. This tool
  can work recursively over directories and supports limiting of the search
  to specific file suffixes.

OPTIONS
  Basic usage is to specify two strings and one or more filenames or directories
  on the command line. The first string is the string to replace, and the second
  string is the replacement string.

  -h, --help         A short help text.
  -L, --license      Show the license and exit.
  -xSUFFIX           Search only files ending with SUFFIX, e.g. ".txt". May be
                     specified multiple times.
  -i, --ignore-case  Ignore the case of old_string.
  -w, --whole-words  Make old_string match only on word boundaries.
  -b, --backup       Move the original files to filename~ before replacing them.
  -q, --quiet        Quiet mode.
  -v, --verbose      Verbose mode.
  -s, --dry-run      Simulation mode, no files are changed.
  -R, --recursive    Recurse into subdirectories.
  -e, --escape       Expand escape sequences in old_string and new_string.
                     Examples of escape sequences are '\\n' (new-line), '\\t' (tab), '\\x42' (hexadecimal number 42), '\\033' (octal number 033).
  -p, --prompt       Prompt for confirmation before replacing each file.
  -f, --force        Ignore errors when trying to restore permissions and file
                     ownership.
  -d, --keep-times   Keep modification times when replacing files.
  -a, --all          Do not ignore files and directories starting with '.'

EXAMPLES
  Replace all occurrences of "F" (on word boundaries) with "A" in all text
  files under the grades/ directory:

    $ rpl -Rwd -x'.txt' 'F' 'A' grades/

SEE ALSO
  find(1), sed(1).
